### IDT Project Summary

**Core Purpose:**

The IDT is a groundbreaking invention aimed at forging the future of programming.

It introduces a revolutionary 3D environment for programming concepts, transitioning from the 2D terminal to a multi-dimensional space where:

- Binary (1s and 0s) can be bent, shaped, and rotated.
- Programming becomes a fully immersive and interactive experience.

**Target Audience:**

- Anyone with an interest in code.
- **Prerequisites:**
  - Knowledge of Python.
  - Willingness to learn "9Lang," the proprietary language for IDT.

**Goals and Problems Solved:**

The IDT resolves the limitations of traditional 2D terminal interfaces by transitioning into the 3D realm.

- Unlocks a new dimension in programming, enabling unprecedented levels of:
  - Visualization.
  - Collaboration.
  - Interaction.

**Key Features:**

- **Immersive VR/AR Interaction:** Walk through and interact with code structures in 3D space.
- **Real-Time Collaboration:** Multi-user sessions with synchronized views and shared debugging.
- **AI-Assisted Debugging:** Navigate, identify, and resolve issues efficiently with AI support.
- **3D Visualization of Code and Data:** Transform complex code and data structures into dynamic 3D models.
- **Dynamic Debugging:** Trace and interact with live execution flows in a 3D environment.

**Vision Statement:**

"The Interdimensional Terminal is a transformative platform that unlocks the potential of programming in a 3D space, redefining how humans interact with code, data, and debugging, and forging the next frontier of technological innovation."

### 9Lang Syntax

**Core Syntax:**

- `//` Comments
- `||` Vertical stacks
- `< >` Bend, zip, and unzip
- `$` Commands to navigate layers of the world
- `€` Portal setup with 3D coordinates (e.g., `€portal loc loc`)
- `L` Split stacks
- `U` Toggle field of view between 2D and 3D
- `€U` Save and quit
- `exit` Exit without saving
- `@` Rotate anything, including the world
- `#` Climb anything
- `%` Delete anything
- `~~` Traverse data
- `__` Flatten or move anything along an `n xyz` line
- `==` Scale up or down
- `$ip % loc` Remove files from a location
- `$ip <&> loc` Download and install files
- `disconnect` Disconnect from cubes
- `Ctrl + Middle Mouse` Pan around
- `Scroll` Zoom in/out
- `Space` Jump
- `E` Activate stacks or objects

### Use Cases

```plaintext
// Set the file location
ip = "https://example.com/file.zip"
loc = "0, 1, 0"

// Download and place the file in the 3D environment
$ip -> loc

// Validate the file placement
8 validate $ip -> loc

// Define multiple file sources
ip1 = "https://example.com/file1.zip"
ip2 = "https://example.com/file2.zip"
ip3 = "https://example.com/file3.zip"
loc = "2, 3, 4"

// Download multiple files and place them in the location
$ip1, ip2, ip3 -> loc

// Define the file location and operation
ip = "https://example.com/resource"
loc = "5, 6, 7"

// Download and unpack the file
$ip <> loc

// Compress the file with high efficiency and send it back
$ip <> loc high

// Test network connection
ip = "192.168.1.10"
$test ip

// Tether to the remote system
tether cube 192.168.1.10

// Synchronize with the remote system
sync cube 192.168.1.10

// Undo a file placement
8 undo $ip -> loc

// Redo the last undone operation
8 redo $ip -> loc

// Remove a file
$ip % loc

// Download and install
$ip <&> loc

// Disconnect from a cube
disconnect cube 192.168.1.10

// Rotate a stack by 45 degrees
@rotate stack1 45

// Scale a stack by 2
stack1 == 2
```

### Tools and Setup

**Tools:**

- **Unity**: For environment creation.
- **Python**: For backend logic and 9Lang interpreter development.
- **Git**: For version control and collaboration.

**Dependencies:**

- Python libraries: `requests`, `socket`.
- Unity: Ensure input handling is configured for extended controls.

**Security Considerations:**

- Validate IP addresses for networking.
- Use connection timeouts to prevent hangs.

  - **Deliverables**:
    - Vision statement.
    - Key features and goals.
    - Target audience and prerequisites.

---

### **2. Technical Foundation**
- **Backend Development**:
  - Create the 9Lang interpreter in Python.
  - Define syntax, operations, and logic for:
    - File handling.
    - Stack manipulation.
    - Networking and portals.
- **Frontend Development**:
  - Set up Unity for the 3D environment.
  - Implement basic movement, interaction, and camera controls.
- **Deliverables**:
  - Functional interpreter.
  - Basic 3D environment with CubeManager.

### **3. Data Representation and Simulation**
- **Objective**: Represent programming concepts (data structures, functions) as 3D constructs.
- **Tasks**:
  - Map common data structures (arrays, linked lists, graphs) to 3D visuals.
  - Design interactive elements for splitting, fusing, and scaling.
- **Deliverables**:
  - Unity prefabs for data structures.
  - Dynamic interaction and visualization.

---

### **4. Code Execution and Debugging**
- **Objective**: Enable live code execution and debugging in the 3D environment.
- **Tasks**:
  - Implement real-time syntax validation and feedback.
  - Highlight execution flows dynamically.
- **Deliverables**:
  - Functional execution flow visualization.
  - Debugging interface in Unity.

---

### **5. Immersive User Interface**
- **Objective**: Create an intuitive UI for 3D navigation and programming.
- **Tasks**:
  - Design AR/VR-compatible interfaces.
  - Add tooltips, guides, and overlays.
- **Deliverables**:
  - User-friendly, immersive UI.

---

### **6. Collaboration Tools**
- **Objective**: Facilitate real-time multi-user collaboration.
- **Tasks**:
  - Implement multi-user synchronization.
  - Design visual indicators for collaborator actions.
- **Deliverables**:
  - Collaborative programming environment.

---

### **7. Programming and Automation**
- **Objective**: Enable custom scripting and automation.
- **Tasks**:
  - Extend 9Lang syntax for automation.
  - Add APIs for scripting dynamic interactions.
- **Deliverables**:
  - Advanced scripting capabilities.

---

### **8. Testing and Deployment**
- **Objective**: Ensure performance, scalability, and security.
- **Tasks**:
  - Perform unit, integration, and load testing.
  - Optimize Unity rendering and Python networking.
- **Deliverables**:
  - Stable, deployable IDT system.

---

### **Tools and Setup**
- **Core Tools**:
  - Unity for the 3D environment.
